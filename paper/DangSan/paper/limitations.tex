\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\projectname{} tracks only heap objects. Stack objects can be supported similar to heap objects. \metalloc{} provides uniform way to store and retrieve metadata for stack objects. Static instrumentation has to be changed to insert run-time checks at the start and end of function calls. Moreover, we need to handle \texttt{longjmp} that performs non-local jumps. However, frequent stack object allocations and deallocations incur huge overhead. Furthermore, we conservatively instrument pointer store instructions. We can perform advanced inter-procedural and backward data flow analysis to eliminate stack and global objects accurately. One of the optimization is to avoid instrumentation for simple pointer arithmetic like \emph{p++}. Similar to \freesentry{}, we can move instrumented tracking function outside the loop if the same pointer is used in the loop. Also, we can provide function attribute to opt-out function from being instrumented.
