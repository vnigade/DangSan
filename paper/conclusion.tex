\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented \projectname{}, a new memory metadata management scheme
for software security hardening solutions.
Our design is both comprehensive---given that it can handle whole-memory object metadata
in a uniform and transparent way---and efficient---given that it yields a run-time performance
overhead of just 1.2\% in practice.
We believe \projectname{} can bring many instrumentation
solutions within reach for adoption in practice,
allowing, for example, many vulnerability mitigation techniques
to improve software security in an efficient and backward compatible fashion.
