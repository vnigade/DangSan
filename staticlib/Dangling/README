There are two different implementations for the pointer tracking.

Project Structure:
Each design has its own source files. Whenever common code is required it will be taken out into new source file.

1) Based on FreeSentry
    - This design is implemented to check the benifit of Metalloc
    - Gain more understanding and find new issues.
    Files :
        pointer_track.c, pointer_track.h

2) per-Thread log model
    - This design is based on having per-Thread per-Object logs
    - This avoids lock contention or performance degradation introduced by locking
    - This should give huge benefit in multi-threaded environment.
